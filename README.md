# Database-project

Developed a data analysis application for yelp.com's user review data with emphasis on database infrastructure.
Designed a target standalone java application which runs queries on the yelp data and supports two types of search: Business search and User search.
Implemented faceted search for accessing information organized by applying multiple filters/facets as business attributes like review count , year , check in information. The previous facets are remembered as the search goes further and the search space gets narrowed down.
Populated the database (Oracle 11g), communicated with it and ran searches using JDBC connections. Implemented indexing on the huge data of over 20000 users, 10000 Business, 85000 Checkin, 100000 Review and reduced the search area thereby improving the performance of the application.
